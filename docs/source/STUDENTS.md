# Guide for Students

Brainhack School students, please find the instructions regarding several important points that will facilitate your progress with the school 


### How to prepare my project pitch presentation?

Please find the project pitch template [here](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/11QnKJ7L8IM6aCF3WbgtxDzIbc3P_IplVP9bItvxZtWg/edit?usp=sharing). Please make a copy of the presentation at your own local and edit as necessary. You are free to choose your color/font/template scheme. Keep it brief and short, that would not go longer than the recommended number of slides. 



### How to create my project repository?

Please follow the instructions in the [“Using Git and Github” module](https://school-brainhack.github.io/modules/git_github/#:~:text=wants%20a%20refresher!-,Exercise,-send%20a%20request) exercise that will show you the steps to create a repository under [Brainhack School project organization](https://github.com/brainhack-school2023). 



### How should I structure my project repository?

Please do have a look at the repositories from the [previous year’s project Github organization](https://github.com/brainhack-school2022 ) to get an idea. In general, we expect you to have a readme file where you can describe your project with goals and deliverables, resources, references and code base that you will be using during your project development. 

### How should I create a project issue template? 

Please visit the [Brainhack School Projects](https://github.com/brainhack-school2023/brainhack_school_projects) repository and choose [issues](https://github.com/brainhack-school2023/brainhack_school_projects/issues). Click on the new issues then you will see “Project Submission Template”. This will open a template issue format with several questions for you to fill in for your project. Do not worry you can always change, edit/remove what you added to the issue. 



### How can I add labels to my project issue? 

On the right hand of the issue, you will find the labels. Please make sure that you might not find labels one-to-one matching your project description, but some approximate ones. Therefore use the ones you feel like it represents your project the best. 

Please do not forget to add the label that represents the name of your hub! 


### Why should I add labels to my project issue?

We highly encourage our students to expose themselves to their peers’ projects and learn from each other, share their constructive feedback and help each other. These labels, therefore, will help your peers to search through some basic keywords to find your project and engage with you easily. 


### How can I submit the latest project template? 

When that exciting day arrives please go to [Project Template](https://school-brainhack.github.io/project/template/) page that explains every single step that you have to follow to complete your project submission successfully. This will create a page for your project that will showcase all the details and outputs of your project. Please do have a look at the examples from the [Projects page](https://school-brainhack.github.io/project/)
