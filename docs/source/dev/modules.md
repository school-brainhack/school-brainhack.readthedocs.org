# Guide for Updating and Adding Modules

Each year we update the BrainHack School modules, and this year we would also like to add any new modules that would be of interest to students.

We would love it if this was a community effort! 

## Updating current modules 
- Go to the [school website](https://school-brainhack.github.io/modules/) and find the module(s) that interest you 
- Open an [issue for modifying the modules](https://github.com/school-brainhack/school-brainhack.github.io/issues) on the school website [GitHub repo](https://github.com/school-brainhack/school-brainhack.github.io/) about your ideas for updates needed.
      - Add updates you think are necessary, for example: ensuring links, resources and exercises reflect the state-of-the-art; videos are of good quality 
        and reflect the materials
- Complete a PR to the [Github repo](https://github.com/school-brainhack/school-brainhack.github.io/) with your suggested updates

## Adding new modules
- Modules should adhere to the following standards:
    - Use free, open source tools, including Python
    - Be of high quality
    - Have a broad appeal

- Here are some module ideas we think would make a great addition to the school (or suggest your own!):
    - Structural imaging
    - Diffusion imaging
    - Neuroimage file format: [Related Issue](https://github.com/school-brainhack/school-brainhack.github.io/issues/130)
    - Debugging: [Related Issue](https://github.com/school-brainhack/school-brainhack.github.io/issues/151

- To add a new module
    - Familiarize yourself with the structure of the [current modules](https://github.com/school-brainhack/school-brainhack.github.io/tree/main/content/en/modules)
    - Open an [issue for adding new modules](https://github.com/school-brainhack/school-brainhack.github.io/issues) to discuss your idea using the template provided
    - Once youâ€™ve drafted your module, complete a PR
    - Then we will ask other members of the community to review it to check it meets the standards above.
