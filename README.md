# Brainhack School – Developer Documentation

This repository hosts the developer documentation for the Brainhack School website and platform infrastructure.

📚 The live documentation is hosted on [school-brainhack.readthedocs.org](https://school-brainhack.readthedocs.org). It is built using the [Sphinx](https://www.sphinx-doc.org) documentation engine, with most of the content written in Markdown (via `myst-parser`) and structured under `docs/source/`.

## Structure

* `docs/source/` – Markdown and `.rst` source files for the docs
* `docs/build/` – Output folder (HTML site generated by Sphinx)
* `docs/source/img/` – Images used in the documentation
* `README.md` – This file
* `requirements.txt` – Python dependencies

## 📦 Installation

To build the documentation locally:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Then:

```bash
cd docs
make html
```

The site will be built in `docs/build/html/`. Open `index.html` in a browser to preview.

If you're making structural changes (like renaming files or adjusting the table of contents), it's often safer to clear the `build/` folder first:

```bash
rm -rf build/*
make html
```

## ✍️ Editing the Docs

Content is located in `docs/source/`. Each Markdown (`.md`) or reStructuredText (`.rst`) file represents a page in the documentation.

* `index.rst` – The root table of contents (includes all other sections)
* `dev/` – Developer-facing Hugo documentation (site config, content, deployment)
* `img/` – Images referenced using `img/filename.png`
* `_static/` – Additional downloadable files (e.g. PDFs or zipped datasets)

To add a new section:

1. Create a new `.md` file inside `docs/source/dev/`
2. Update `index.rst` or use the `:glob:` directive to auto-include it
